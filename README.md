# Overview

Hatch was developed as a part of a research study I did, "A Novel Blockchain-based, Decentralized Application for Equitable Access to Capital and Power." Overall, it is an NFT marketplace where a portion of NFT sales go to supporting a public good. 

Scaling the Ethereum blockchain has been a problem since its origin in Vitalik Buterin's white paper. Layer 2 (L2) is a collective term to describe an Ethereum scaling solution that is built on top of Ethereum and inherits its security. Arbitrum is a L2 optimistic rollup that uses interactive fraud proofs to enable Ethereum decentralized applications (dApp) to execute transactions at faster speeds and lower costs. Arbitrum One Mainnet Beta opened to the public in August 2021 for dApp development and usage. This necessitates more applied research directed at dAppsâ€™ security and usability in order to achieve broader blockchain-based technology adoption. In the paper, I describe how I design, develop, and security engineer Hatch, a dApp on Arbitrum, and present a working prototype implementation.

Code for Hatch is in the master branch.
